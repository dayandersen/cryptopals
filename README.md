# cryptopals

### Overview:
This is a fun project to learn rust and encourage brain to not be so smol.

Source of all the challenges is here: https://cryptopals.com/


You can run the project with `cargo build; cargo run` , but everything so far has actually been ran mostly via tests.


### Current status:

Set1: Everything up to Challenge 6 completed. Challenge 6 partially working. My xor key generation is resulting in a slightly off key, "TErMinator X: BRing thE noise" vs the real key of "Terminator X: Bring the noise", this makes the output all slightly off.

Set 2 - Set N: Not started
